# khareedARi - web AR experience with Zappar SDk
Our web AR-based prototype provides solutions to retail or small e-commerce websites using technologies such as WebAR through Zappar. Our solution allows users to access AR content without the need to download a separate app or software. This can be experienced on a wide range of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices.

## How we built it
We have built a prototype to provide Web AR-based solution to a wide range of small businesses like Jewelry, furniture, fashion etc. We have used Unity game engine with Zapper SDK to develop Web AR based experience. Some of our prototype features include - 
FASHION - AR technology can also be used to enhance fashion shows and other events. For example, AR could be used to project virtual models or clothing onto a physical runway, or to display additional information about the garments being shown.
